### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    I liked Lab 4 Part 2, because of the conversions. Conversions were interesting to me because I always thought conversions were fun and interesting how conversions were done through code. This lab taught me about arguments. I didn’t understand how arguments worked before then. Now I know how they are a value that is passed to a function whenever that specific function is called. 

* Lab 7

    I liked Lab 7 Part 2, because I really enjoyed creating code to play blackjack. I started playing blackjack in 9th grade and I fell in love with the game after watching the movie 21. It was the only casino card game that I felt had a sort of mathematical advantage. To create a game with code to play blackjack was one of the best projects we ever had.

* Lab 10

    I like Lab 10 Part 3, because it was the first time we used MagickInitialize and ColorRGB. It was the first time we used Color in our code. It was difficult at first to understand because Magick didn’t always Initialize but I did like it being our first project with Color.
